# Italy-gas-price

Italy's different gas price comparison through 2005-2021 August
Data was found in Kaggle dataset section -- https://www.kaggle.com/rafabelokurows/weekly-fuel-prices-in-italy

LR = Linear Regression
RME = Root mean error


 While exploring through kaggle data set section I caught sigh of this data set (Italy's gas price) and thought it might be a good data set for Linear Regression model, because at the same time I was studying about LR ML models, so decided to get some practical knowledge about LR model. 
 
Main goal of LR model is to predict final price of a gas by having - product_id, excise, net ( net price of a gas). Evaluation metric is RME.

RME results - 20.8536

Summary: Got basic knowledge of a LR model, learned how to add column based on condition  



To add - more comparison variations (scatter plot),
upgrade LR model,
